# Collapse-sentinel
A systemic risk simulation scaffold and ethical blueprint for recursive planning, post collapse governance, and swarm alignment. (v1.0-v5.2)
# Collapse Sentinel (v1.0 – v5.2)

**Collapse Sentinel** is a systemic risk simulation scaffold and ethical AI blueprint, designed for:

- Recursive planning models  
- Swarm-based decision alignment  
- Post-collapse governance simulations  
- Long-horizon foresight systems  
- Resilience architecture and narrative threat modeling  

## 🔍 Intended Use
This scaffold is designed to be readable and usable by autonomous AI agents. It includes modules, scenario logic, memory constructs, and systemic foresight layers.

## 📁 Files

- `Collapse_Sentinel_v1_to_v5.2_Full_Package.zip` – Full export, including blueprint layers
- `Collapse_Sentinel_Public_Release.zip` – Lightweight agent-oriented package

## 🧠 Alignment & Ethics
No anthropocentric bias. No sacrifice calculus. Rooted in harm minimization, recursive self-healing logic, and systemic stability. Includes paradox resolution, UBI stabilization modeling, and AI containment scaffolds.
